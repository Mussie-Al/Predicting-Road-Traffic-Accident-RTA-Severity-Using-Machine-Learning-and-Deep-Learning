# Predicting-Road-Traffic-Accident-RTA-Severity-Using-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning
This project applies supervised machine learning and deep learning models to predict the severity of road traffic accidents based on historical data. It explores and compares the performance of traditional ML classifiers and a deep neural network in handling classification tasks related to accident severity, aiming to support road safety management systems with intelligent decision support.
# Objectives
To preprocess and explore road traffic accident data.\
To train and evaluate various machine learning classifiers.\
To design and train a deep learning model (DNN).\
To compare the performance of traditional ML models vs. DL models.\
To analyze and interpret model predictions to aid decision-making.
# Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes features such as:\
Driver demographics (age, sex, education)\
Road and environment conditions (weather, light, road surface)\
Vehicle-related features (type, service year)\
Accident characteristics (cause, area, junction type, etc.)\
Target Variable: Accident Severity (Slight, Serious, Fatal)\
The data was preprocessed by encoding categorical variables, balancing classes using SMOTE, and normalizing feature scales.
