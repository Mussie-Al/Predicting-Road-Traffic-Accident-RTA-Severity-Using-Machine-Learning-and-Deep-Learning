# Predicting-Road-Traffic-Accident-RTA-Severity-Using-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning
This project applies supervised machine learning and deep learning models to predict the severity of road traffic accidents based on historical data. It explores and compares the performance of traditional ML classifiers and a deep neural network in handling classification tasks related to accident severity.
